    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2> My Name is Benjamin Nodland. I was born in Seoul South Korea and was adopted to a family in Minneapolis Minnesota.
        After an uneventful childhood I signed up to join the military my senior year of High School. This was shortly after Sept 11th, 2001. 
        I have been stationed several places around the globe over my 20 years of service.<br />


        Portland Oregon is my current home and will probably be my last duty station before retirement. I have a great wife and dog that keep me company.
